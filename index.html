    <p class="intro-para">So far I have been studying computer science at the University of Utah for about 3 years. Not 
        including my gen ed classes, I have a total of about 2 years studying computer science material. Most of the Projects
        I have done for now include school related projects, but I plan on making more projects over the years.

                Currently there is no link to my projects as this webpage has been created recently.
            Check back in the future for links to my projects if you want to check them out.
            (P.S. I'm currently studying for an algorithms test, so hopefully by next week or May 7th my links 
            will be posted.)

              <h2>Black Jack Education App</h2>
              <p>
                This project dealt with creating our very own education application, where me and my
                team were to devolop an application on QT to teach other people about a certain subject.
                For our project we decided to teach black jack, and our app comes with a bunch of features.
                This gave me more practice with team work and it also was very interesting to be able
                to create an application as a team without getting the specifics of what we needed to do.

              <h2>Sprite Editor</h2>
              <p>With this project, me and a team of 6 made a sprite editor with c++ on QT.
                In this project we learned how to work together to create an idea for how to implement
                a sprite editor. This project can save files, load files, it can animate the sprite and
                you can change different accessability features. This project was a fun way to get to work
                with others as it was one of the first where I worked with a group of more than 2 people.

                <h2>Phrase Generator</h2>
                <p>
                    This project was on of my favorites, and with this project I worked with a partner where
                    we were to develop a phrase generator given a text file full of phrases. This phrase generator
                    in particular created a poem from scratch using the text file. This was a fun project and I love
                    the phrases it generates.

                <h2>Galaxy Quest Assignment</h2>
                <p> This specific Assignment was very entertaining as it made me use code to 
                    develop a somewhat real solution to a problem.This problem was an Assignment
                    from my algorithms class and it dealt with a galactic dungeon where a 
                    glactic warrior had to escape a maze of corridors while maintaining the most 
                    mass as possible.

              <h2>Python First Game</h2>
              <p>This game is near and dear to my heart. It was one of the first video game implementations
                I made and it works like a maze game where I have to consecutively reach the next level. Overall this 
                game was an introduction to all possiblities that I could do creatively with code. I particularly enjoyed
                this project because turtle objects made the work simpler than how I expected it to work.
